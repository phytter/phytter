### Hey there 👋

- My interest in the world of tecnology, is so broad that computer science, well, maybe that's what got me into computer science course. My main development skills are creating web applications using ReactJS and TypeScript to front-end, NodeJS and Python to back-end.

- To develop i use best practics like clean code and some architecture to keep things separate like clean architecture, DDD, Port and Adapters...

- Some tools and language 🛠️
 

### Other horizons 🌅️

- How i said before, my interest is wide. I like to study about I.A algorithmics, the most i spend my time is computer vision area.
